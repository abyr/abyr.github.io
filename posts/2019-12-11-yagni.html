<p>
YAGNI (You aren't gonna need it)!
</p>

<p>
YAGNI principle means do just what you need at the moment. Don't put any efforts on useless things.
</p>

<p>
The effects of following YAGNI principle are better code and faster implementation.
</p>

<p>
Following the principle lets you get rid of extra functionality and extra complexity. It's about how to keep things simple.
</p>

<p>
YAGNI means don't waste your time at the moment and don't steal your time in the future. If you need something in a week or later than you just do it in a week or later.
</p>

<p>
You have a minimum of a code. Upfront thinking with guesses can pollute the code with unreasonable abstractions and useless complexity.
</p>


<div id="Negative effects"><h1 id="Negative effects" class="header"><a href="#Negative effects">Negative effects</a></h1></div>

<p>
YAGNI has an important side effect you should remember. Simple implentation requires a detailed description of a functionality and a required result. Short iterations help you to decrease a value of this effect.
</p>

<p>
What to do next once implementation is done?
</p>

<p>
```
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It is done.

<li>
Is it slow?

<li>
No, it's fast enough.

<li>
Than just keep it as is.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
OK, it is slow.

<li>
Try to make it faster.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Actually, not really too slow.

<li>
Then just keep it.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
But It can work better.

<li>
Is it needed now?

<li>
No.

<li>
Keep it.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Hm.. Yes, it is needed now.

<li>
OK. Improve it.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
I'm not sure if we needed it.

<li>
Keep it and ask people who is responsible for planning.

</ul>

<p>
The best things to optimize are smells in a code.
</p>

<p>
Duplicated code. Lots of duplications are dangerous and time wasting.
Don't collect them. Extract a method or a class to save your time in the future.
</p>

<p>
Conditional complexity and nested conditions are hard to read. Usually we are spending 90% of our time reading the code. Don't keep it hard to read. Make a named operation and don't make you to remember your decision. Extract a method to save your time on replacing one conditional with another one faster.
</p>

<p>
Don't use comments a lot. They starts to lie during the time. Remove a comment and make it  a part of an active code, make it readable and replaceable code. People don't always read comments as a part of a passive code. Just remove them and don't let them to lie in the future.
</p>

<p>
Temporary fields. Watch out of low cohesion and extra or optional fields. Remove them if it is possible and a code stays readable without them.
</p>

<p>
Combinatorial Explosion. It's a kind of a duplication. Keep it simple. Use the previous or the best method in all places if it is possible.
</p>

<p>
Feature Envy. It's a real time bomb. You become dependent of the envy usage. Don't let high cohesion to make things complicated. There should be only a single responsibility to edit the module. Prefer aggregation to inheritance. Move envy method or extract it.
</p>

<p>
Remember things change. Something looks important today but tomorrow it becames useless. Making all implementation as a proof of concept can help you to start replace and refactor instead of rewrite everything.
