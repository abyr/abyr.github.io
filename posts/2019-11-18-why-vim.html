<div id="Why Vim?"><h1 id="Why Vim?" class="header"><a href="#Why Vim?">Why Vim?</a></h1></div>

<p>
So, I got this question again. I think it's better to write it once so I can use my own notes instead of a arguing again and again. Also it would be a note for myself to remember why I still use it.
</p>

<div id="Good words"><h1 id="Good words" class="header"><a href="#Good words">Good words</a></h1></div>

<p>
It's personal. I like Vim and as many other programs. All of them are good for something. But... Again, it's personal. These next reasons are valuable to me, so that's why...
</p>

<p>
It works everywere. I'm working with a program code a lot. I have multiple development environments that I only access through SSH. Vim is easy to install and I know how to make it work with no configs, plugins, etc. Also my minimal .vimrc config lives under a version control so I can download it everywhere. I prefer to work with a remote file system remotely. Vim is good in this case. I don't like to learn hotkeys for every good editor. Maybe Vim has much more but I use limited set of them.
</p>

<p>
It has lots of configurations, plugins, color themes. I can change mappings, save them into <code>.vimrc</code> and use them on any machine. I don't do it often but I like to experiment with different settings. I have minimal config, config for coding, config for writing with different sets of plugins. I also like to change themes often.
</p>

<p>
The documentation is really well. It's alwas a pleasure to Vim's documentation.
"A feature that isn't documented is a useless feature." -- Vim docs. See <code>:h design-documented</code>
</p>

<p>
Small and lightweight. Vim has really small latencies between key is pressed and got a result on screen. Vim don't eat my resources. It's really important to me.
</p>

<p>
I often use midnight commander, ranger, git. And I can use Vim with all of them as well as with any program or shell command that uses <code>$EDITOR</code>.
</p>

<p>
Newer doesn't mean Better. I always give a try to some other editors. Some of them are too slow, other have bugs or miss functions. Vim just works.
</p>

<p>
Vim is free and open source by the way.
</p>

<div id="Bad words"><h1 id="Bad words" class="header"><a href="#Bad words">Bad words</a></h1></div>

<p>
Also I have a few bad words about Vim.
</p>

<p>
It was hard to learn it. It took me about a month to start use it wisely. And I still learning it.
</p>

<p>
If you need other people to help you then choose some another editor. Not a big deal.
</p>

<p>
Vim is not so efficient if you need a lot of copy and paste in multiple files.
</p>

<p>
Once you get used to Vim, it becomes hard to use other editors.
